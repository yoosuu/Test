>Network architecture
>##### Full mesh connection should be made between CNs.
>##### So, You need to configure the firewall to allow ingress between nodes.

* For communication and multichannel between CN, allow TCP `32323-32324` and UDP `32323` to your firewall ingress rule.
* We will share CN node IPs for Pre-cypress configuration separately.
